    <title>Project 2: Chinese Population Data</title>
  <body>
    <h1>China's Past Population is Indicative of their Future</h1>
    <h3>Visualizations created by Michael Rooney</h3>
    <h4>Chinese population data exploration</h4>
    <p>Chess is a game which appears to be increasingly complex the more you get into learning it. From my perspective, just the thought of playing higher rated players who knew exponentially
      more about openings and strategy than I did made it appear that catching up or even beating them once was futile. I went into exploring this dataset to dispel this myth and to hopefully
      reassure other novice chess players that there was less to learn and memorize (at least with regards to openings) than they mght think. <b>My hypothesis is that most of the popular openings contain a relatively
        small number of moves and that lower rated players defeating higher rated players happens often regardless of the differential.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>The first topic we are looking at is openings. Chess.com highlights how important openings are for beginners to learn and that <a href=https://chesspathways.com/chess-openings>chess isn't just a memorization contest.</a>
    The graphs below display the data from a <a href=https://lichess.org>Lichess</a> dataset <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess>found on Kaggle</a>. The first relationship we will be exploring
    is between the number of opening moves and the type of opening.
